    A delicious, spicy blend packed full of iron and low in fat to boot. It's ready in under half an hour, or can be
    made in a slow cooker

    <br><h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>pinch chilli flakes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>600g carrots, washed and coarsely grated (no need to peel)</li>
        <li>140g split red lentils</li>
        <li>1l hot vegetable stock (from a cube is fine)</li>
        <li>125ml milk (to make it dairy-free, see 'try' below)</li>
        <li>plain yogurt and naan bread, to serve</li>

    </ul>
    <br><h2><strong>Step-By-Step</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>STEP 1:</strong>Heat a large saucepan and dry-fry 2 tsp cumin seeds and a pinch of chilli flakes for
            1 min, or until they start to jump around the pan and release their aromas.</li>
        <li><strong>STEP 2:</strong>Scoop out about half with a spoon and set aside. Add 2 tbsp olive oil, 600g coarsely
            grated carrots, 140g split red
            lentils, 1l hot vegetable stock and 125ml milk to the pan and bring to the boil.
        </li>
        <li><strong>STEP 3</strong>
            Simmer for 15 mins until the lentils have swollen and softened.
        </li>
        <li><strong>STEP 4</strong>
            Whizz the soup with a stick blender or in a food processor until smooth (or leave it chunky if you prefer).
        </li>
        <li><strong>STEP 5</strong>
            Season to taste and finish with a dollop of plain yogurt and a sprinkling of the reserved toasted spices.
            Serve with warmed naan breads.
